                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hi there! I’m a self-taught web developer with a passion for bringing data to life through clean
                        code
                        and thoughtful design. <br>
                        I work primarily with HTML, CSS/SASS, PHP, and JavaScript—and I’m always curious to explore new
                        languages and technologies when inspiration strikes.<br>
                        My skillset also includes working with SQL and databases, which I enjoy shaping into efficient,
                        reliable backends for dynamic websites and tools.<br>
                        Whether it's crafting a custom CMS, visualizing user data, or building interactive interfaces, I
                        aim
                        to create digital solutions that just make sense.<br>
                        I like to think of myself as a friendly hacker—the kind who solves everyday challenges with
                        clever
                        tech, not the kind in a hoodie breaking into your WiFi. Coding may not be my full-time job, but
                        it’s
                        definitely my favorite way to unwind and think creatively.</p>
